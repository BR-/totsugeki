2. Run `totsugeki.exe`
3. üê¨

Removing Totsugeki is as simple as deleting the executable and launching the game normally.

## Features

- 3-4x Speedup compared to vanilla Strive.
- No installation or messing with system files. Just download and run.
- No admin permissions needed.
- 100% transparent: Sends data bit-for-bit the same as vanilla Strive. No stat or lobby inconsistencies.

## Building

Tested with Golang 1.16, but probably will compile with Golang 1.13+.

### Installing from source

`go install github.com/optix2000/totsugeki`

### Building from cloned repo

`go build`

## The technical nitty gritty

GGST makes a new TCP connection and a new TLS connection _every_ API call it makes. [And it makes hundreds of them in the title screen](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/oaqwo5/analysis_of_network_traffic_at_game_startup/).

Totsugeki solves this by proxying all API requests through a keepalive connection.

What this means is instead of doing 4 round trips (TCP + TLS + HTTP) for each API call, it only needs to do 1 (HTTP only). This shortens the loading time by a factor of FOUR!
For example, if you live in the EU and have ~300ms ping to the GGST servers, you usually see something like `300ms * (1 TCP round trip * 2 TLS round trips + 1 HTTP Request round trip) = 1.2 seconds` per API call.

This multiplied across all 127 API calls needed to get to the main menu means it takes a whopping 152 seconds (2.5 minutes) to load into GGST.

With Totsugeki, this is brought down to a mere 38 seconds.

This has added bonus of reducing GGST server load, as TLS negotiation is one of the most CPU intensive tasks today.

Thanks to u/TarballX for doing the initial research on why GGST takes so long to connect.
